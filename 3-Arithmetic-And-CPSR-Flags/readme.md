# Arithmetic Operations and CPSR Flags

In ARM Assembly language, arithmetic operations involve manipulating data using various instructions like `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, etc., and these operations can affect the CPSR (Current Program Status Register) flags. The CPSR flags are special bits in the processor status register that reflect the outcome of arithmetic and logical operations.<br>
Here's a breakdown of arithmetic operations and how they interact with CPSR flags, along with examples:
