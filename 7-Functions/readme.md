# Functions in ARM Assembly

In ARM Assembly language, functions are used to encapsulate blocks of code that perform specific tasks, allowing for modularity and reusability in programs. Functions are typically defined with a label and are called using a `BL` (Branch with Link) instruction. They can have parameters passed via registers and return values using specific conventions. Let's explore how functions are implemented in ARM Assembly with examples.

## Anatomy of a Function

A typical function in ARM Assembly consists of the following components:

- **Function Label:** Defines the entry point of the function.
- **Function Body:** Contains the code that performs the specific task.
- **Function Prologue:** Sets up the stack frame (if needed) and saves any necessary registers.
- **Function Epilogue:** Restores any modified registers and cleans up the stack frame before returning.
