# Condition And Branches

## Comparators in ARM Assembly

In ARM Assembly language, comparators are used to perform comparisons between two operands or values. These comparisons typically set the CPSR (Current Program Status Register) flags based on the result of the comparison, which can then be used in conditional branching or other decision-making instructions. The most commonly used comparators are `CMP` (Compare) and `TST` (Test).
